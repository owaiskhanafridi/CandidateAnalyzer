**ï»¿Instructions to Use the Code: Analyze a Candidate's Resume Based on Job Description**

This Python code analyzes a candidate's resume by comparing the skills listed in the resume with those mentioned in a job description. The script calculates the skill match percentage to determine how well the candidate's skills align with the job requirements.

Steps to Use the Code
Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. Use the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install PyPDF2 nltk
Prepare Input Files:

Resume File: Save the candidate's resume as a PDF (e.g., Resume.pdf).
Job Description File: Save the job description as a plain text file (e.g., job_description.txt).
Customize the Skill List:

Update the SKILLS list in the script with additional skills relevant to the jobs you're analyzing.
Run the Code:

Update the file paths for the resume (pdf_path) and job description (job_description_path) in the script.
Run the script in your Python environment:
bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Output Explanation:

Resume Skills: Skills identified in the candidate's resume.
Job Description Skills: Skills extracted from the job description.
Skill Match Percentage: The percentage of overlap between the skills in the resume and the job description.

**Example Usage:**

Replace Resume.pdf with the path to the candidate's resume PDF.
Replace job_description.txt with the path to the job description file.
python
Copy code
pdf_path = 'Resume.pdf'  # Path to the resume PDF
job_description_path = 'job_description.txt'  # Path to the job description file

main(pdf_path, job_description_path)

**Expected Output:**

The script will display the following:

Extracted Skills from Resume: A list of matched skills in the resume.
Extracted Skills from Job Description: A list of skills in the job description.
Skill Match Percentage: The percentage alignment of the candidate's skills with the job requirements.
Additional Notes:
Skill List Customization:

Modify the SKILLS list to include industry-specific skills or keywords for better accuracy.
Expand Functionality:

Include additional metrics, such as keyword frequency, or compare soft skills if needed.

**Error Handling:**

Ensure proper file paths and formats are provided to avoid errors during execution.
This script provides an efficient way to assess resume-job fit, making it ideal for recruiters or candidates preparing for targeted job applications.
